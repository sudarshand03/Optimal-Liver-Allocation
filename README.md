# Optimal-Liver-Allocation


A Python project for implementing static and dynamic liver‐exchange mechanisms, based on Ergin, Sönmez & Ünver "Efficent and Incentive Compatible Liver Exchange" (2020) and Akbarpour, Li, Gharan "Thickness and Information in Dynamic Matching Markets"

## Overview

This repository implements:

- **Static precedence-induced adaptive-priority mechanism** for two-way liver exchanges  
- **Dynamic matching policies** (Greedy, Patient, Patient α) and an MDP scaffold  
- Reference papers in `papers/`
